# go-iot-dataflows
dataflows for iot using go-iot

we're moving code out of its original home in (ai-power-mvp)[https://github.com/illmade-knight/ai-power-mvp]

our first dataflow is for a [gardenmonitor](gardenmonitor)

dataflows should follow the same structure with code and deployment for each microservice

if the deployment is to google cloud unified deployment code will be in a gcpdeploy directory

end to end tests in a teste2e directory should verify all expected behaviour along with load tests for the dataflows
