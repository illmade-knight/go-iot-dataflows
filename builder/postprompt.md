### please try and

gemini only allows a limited number of files to be uploaded at a time.

If the files I show you refer to types, structs, funcs etc.. that you have not seen
do not try to automatically create them, instead ask me if they already exist and if 
necessary ask me to upload them.

If you are about to undertake a large refactor ask me - 
and explain the reasons before changing code I have not directly asked to be updated.

Always show code in full - I do not like snippets or code that contains comments such as 
"the implementation remains the same" and then skips showing the original code.

could you always check for .comcom errors in imports these seem very common and are annoying

when testing prefer using channels or sync to using time.sleep() or delays to solve race conditions from timing
