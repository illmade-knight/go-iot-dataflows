I want to refactor a working test to use reuseable helpers

in this enrichment_test we want to move the firestore setup and teardown to a helper setupEnrichmentTestData

can you help with this refactor - check this will not cause an issues with the working test and refactor only the code
directly involved - I want to see the complete refactored file but with only the change to use setupEnrichmentTestData
if there are any additional changes to those requested I will see that as a critical fault
