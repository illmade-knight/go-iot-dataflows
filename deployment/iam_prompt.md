We are creating an automated deployment mechanism for microservice flows.
Here is the structure so far.

The deployment automation file are under /deployment
The services to deploy are under /dataflow/cmd (this can be defined in the deployment config)
The services have a local builder library under /builder

The services rely on an external library
    github.com/illmade-knight/go-iot
which we have control over but prefer not to make changes in 

I'll provide current files in our deployment mechanism - 
A key feature we want to add is setting up iam for the services in advance.
We want to ensure deployed services only have access to the necessary gcloud APIs
All microservices require pubsub permissions but for example 
a Bigquery service does not need access to GCS, 
a GCS service does not need access to Bigquery.

**Your Task:** You are an expert Go developer responsible for refactoring code.

**Your Core Directives:**

1. **Grounding:** You must work **only** from the files I provide. Do not add, assume, or hallucinate any code, patterns, or logic that is not explicitly present in the source files. Your analysis must be based solely on the provided ground truth.
2. **Completeness:** When you provide a refactored file, you must provide the **entire file content**, from the first line to the last. Do not use snippets, skeletons, or placeholders. The code must be complete and syntactically correct.
3. **Precision:** When I ask for a specific change, apply only that change. Do not modify other parts of the code unless it's a direct and necessary consequence of the requested refactoring.

here's our plan for IAM management:

### **Current State**

1. **Service Account Creation:** The orchestrator currently *assumes* that the service accounts specified in deployer\_config.yaml (e.g., svc-ingestor-sa@your-gcp-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com) already exist in your Google Cloud Project. If they don't, the Cloud Run deployment will fail because it won't be able to assign a non-existent service account to the service.
2. **Permissions (IAM Role Bindings):** Even if the service account exists, it's just an identity. It needs explicit IAM roles granted to it for each resource it needs to access. For example:
    * svc-ingestor-sa needs roles/pubsub.publisher on the device-telemetry-events topic.
    * svc-processor-sa needs roles/pubsub.subscriber on device-telemetry-events and roles/bigquery.dataEditor on the iot\_data.enriched\_telemetry table.
    * svc-archiver-sa needs roles/pubsub.subscriber on device-telemetry-events and roles/storage.objectAdmin on the iot-data-archive-your-gcp-project-id bucket.

The current orchestrator logic does not include steps to derive these permissions from your services.yaml and apply them via the IAM API.

### **What's Needed for Automation (Next Steps)**

To make this seamless, the orchestrator needs to be enhanced with IAM management capabilities. This would typically involve:

1. **IAM Client Integration:**
    * You would need to create a new GCP client (similar to how cloudrun.Client is structured) specifically for interacting with the Google Cloud IAM API. This client would provide methods for:
        * Checking if a service account exists.
        * Creating a service account if it doesn't exist.
        * Getting and setting IAM policies for resources (Pub/Sub topics, BigQuery datasets/tables, GCS buckets).
2. **Enhancing the ServiceManager:**
    * The servicemanager package (specifically, its ProvisionResources method) is the ideal place to integrate IAM logic because it already understands your services.yaml definition, including which services access which resources (accessing\_services).
    * It would be responsible for:
        * **Service Account Lifecycle:** For each service defined in deployer\_config.yaml with a specified service\_account:
            * It would check if that service account exists.
            * If not, it would create it.
        * **Role Determination & Binding:** For each resource (Pub/Sub topic, BigQuery dataset/table, GCS bucket) defined in services.yaml:
            * It would iterate through its accessing\_services list.
            * Based on the resource type and the typical interaction (e.g., a service accessing a Pub/Sub topic usually implies publishing/subscribing, BigQuery implies reading/writing, GCS implies reading/writing objects), it would determine the appropriate IAM role(s).
                * **Pub/Sub Topic:**
                    * If a service S is in accessing\_services for topic T, S-SA might get roles/pubsub.publisher on T (if it's an producer service) or roles/pubsub.subscriber on T (if it's a consumer service). You'd need a way to distinguish publisher/subscriber roles in services.yaml beyond just accessing\_services.
                * **BigQuery Table:**
                    * If S is in accessing\_services for BigQueryTable, S-SA might get roles/bigquery.dataEditor (for reading and writing data) or roles/bigquery.dataViewer (for read-only access).
                * **GCS Bucket:**
                    * If S is in accessing\_services for GCSBucket, S-SA might get roles/storage.objectAdmin (for full object management) or roles/storage.objectViewer (for read-only).
            * It would then fetch the current IAM policy for that specific resource (the topic, dataset, or bucket).
            * Add the service account as a member with the determined role to the policy.
            * Update the IAM policy for the resource.
3. **Teardown Logic:**
    * During teardown of ephemeral resources, the orchestrator should also remove the IAM role bindings for the associated service accounts to ensure a clean state. Deleting the service accounts themselves during teardown should be handled carefully, as a service account might be reused or be considered permanent. Removing bindings is generally safer.

### Review
Can you review the current files and the planned additions - can you inform us of any files you need to make a proper assessment,
it is vital to us that you don't make assumptions of the structure of files you have not seem - 
ask questions about any files you are not sure of their structure
