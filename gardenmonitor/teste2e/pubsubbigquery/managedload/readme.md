### **The Strategy: Service Manager as a Test Engine**

The servicemanager will become the setup and teardown engine for your integration and load tests. The test itself will no longer be responsible for creating Pub/Sub topics or BigQuery datasets. Instead, it will tell the ServiceManager *which dataflow* it wants to test, and the manager will handle the provisioning.

Here is the step-by-step interaction:

#### **1\. Test Initialization: From Manual to Declarative Setup**

The beginning of your TestE2E\_Cloud\_LoadTest will change significantly.

**Before (Current Approach):**

* Generate unique, random names for topics, subscriptions, datasets, etc.
* Call setupRealPubSub with the random names.
* Call setupRealBigQuery with the random names.

**After (New Approach):**

1. **Load the Definition:** The test will start by creating an instance of your ServicesDefinition, pointing it to your config.yaml file. This is the single source of truth.
2. **Instantiate the Manager:** It will create an instance of the ServiceManager, passing it the ServicesDefinition.
3. **Setup the Dataflow:** The test will make a single call to the SetupDataflow method.

// \--- Inside your TestE2E\_Cloud\_LoadTest \---

// 1\. Load the single source of truth for all infrastructure.  
servicesDef, err := servicemanager.NewYAMLServicesDefinition("../path/to/your/config.yaml")  
require.NoError(t, err)

// 2\. Create the manager that will provision the resources.  
manager, err := servicemanager.NewServiceManager(ctx, servicesDef, "integration-test", testLogger)  
require.NoError(t, err)

// 3\. Set up all resources for the "mqtt-to-bigquery" dataflow in one call.  
// This single call replaces all the manual setup functions like setupRealPubSub etc.  
err \= manager.SetupDataflow(ctx, "integration-test", "mqtt-to-bigquery")  
require.NoError(t, err)

// Define a cleanup function to tear down the dataflow when the test is done.  
t.Cleanup(func() {  
// A TeardownDataflow method would be symmetric to SetupDataflow.  
log.Info().Msg("Tearing down dataflow resources...")  
teardownErr := manager.TeardownDataflow(ctx, "integration-test", "mqtt-to-bigquery")  
assert.NoError(t, teardownErr)  
})

#### **2\. Resource Discovery: Getting the Configuration**

After the ServiceManager has created the resources, your test services (ingestionService and bq-processor) still need to know the names of the topics and subscriptions to connect to.

Instead of using the randomly generated names from before, the test will now use the apiserver's logic *as a library* to fetch the configuration for each service in the dataflow.

// \--- Continuing inside your TestE2E\_Cloud\_LoadTest, after the setup \---

// Use the apiserver's logic (as a library, not over HTTP) to get config.  
apiServerLogic := apiserver.NewServer(servicesDef, testLogger)

// Get the configuration for the ingestion service.  
ingestionConfig, err := apiServerLogic.GetConfigurationForService("ingestion-service", "integration-test")  
require.NoError(t, err)  
require.NotEmpty(t, ingestionConfig.PublishesToTopics)  
ingestionTopicName := ingestionConfig.PublishesToTopics\[0\].Name // e.g., "projects/prj/topics/processed-device-data"

// Get the configuration for the BigQuery processing service.  
bqConfig, err := apiServerLogic.GetConfigurationForService("analysis-service", "integration-test")  
require.NoError(t, err)  
require.NotEmpty(t, bqConfig.ConsumesFromSubscriptions)  
bqSubscriptionName := bqConfig.ConsumesFromSubscriptions\[0\].Name // e.g., "projects/prj/subscriptions/analysis-service-subscription"  
bqTableDetails := bqConfig.AccessesBigQueryTables\[0\]

// \--- Now, configure and start your services using these discovered names \---  
mqttCfg.Publisher.TopicID \= extractResourceID(ingestionTopicName) // Helper to get "processed-device-data"  
//...  
bqProcessorCfg.Consumer.SubscriptionID \= extractResourceID(bqSubscriptionName)  
bqProcessorCfg.BigQuery.DatasetID \= bqTableDetails.DatasetID  
bqProcessorCfg.BigQuery.TableID \= bqTableDetails.TableID  
//...

// ...The rest of your test (starting services, running loadgen) remains the same...

*(Note: GetConfigurationForService is a hypothetical refactoring of the GetServiceConfigHandler logic to make it easily callable from Go code. extractResourceID would be a simple string-splitting helper.)*

### **Benefits of This Approach**

* **High-Fidelity Testing:** Your load test now validates the **exact configuration** you will deploy to production. There is no more divergence between test setup and real setup.
* **Drastically Simplified Tests:** The complex, manual setup and teardown logic in your test file is replaced by just two calls to the ServiceManager.
* **Single Source of Truth:** The config.yaml file governs everything, from production deployments to load testing, ensuring consistency everywhere.
* **Maintainability:** If you add a new GCS bucket to your dataflow, you only need to update the config.yaml. The ServiceManager and the load test will automatically pick up the change without any code modifications.
